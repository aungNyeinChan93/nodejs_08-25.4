what is morgan?
Morgan is an HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js, most commonly used with Express.js.

📌 In Simple Terms:
Morgan logs every incoming request to your server — including the method, URL, status, response time, and more — so you can monitor traffic, debug issues, or generate access logs.

🔧 Why Use Morgan?
🐞 Debugging: Easily spot what requests are hitting your server.

📈 Monitoring: See response times, status codes, etc.

📁 Access logs: Persist logs to a file for audits or analytics.

🎨 Customizable: Use predefined formats or create your own.

🔌 Middleware: Plug-and-play with Express.


📦 Built-in Formats
Morgan provides several predefined formats to quickly log requests:

Format | Description
"combined"	    Logs everything like: IP, date, method, URL, status, referrer, user agent. Similar to Apache’s combined log format.
"common"	    A bit shorter: IP, date, method, URL, status, content length.
"dev"	        Color-coded, concise logs for development. Includes method, URL, status, response time.
"short"	        Minimal output, showing basic request data.
"tiny"	        Very minimal – method, URL, status, and response time

🛠️ Custom Format Strings
Token | Meaning
:method | HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
:url | Request URL
:status | HTTP status code
:res[header] | Response header value
:req[header] | Request header value
:response-time | Time (ms) to finish the response
:date | Date and time of the request
:remote-addr | IP address of the client
:referrer or :ref | Referrer header
:user-agent | User agent string
:http-version | HTTP version
:remote-user | Authenticated user (if any)
:content-length | Response content length

eg: custome Format 
app.use(morgan(':method :url :status :res[content-length] - :response-time ms'));


- immediate option 
📌 Logs request before response is sent. This is useful if:

You want to measure how many requests are hitting your server (even if some time out or fail).

You want logs even if response handling throws errors.

app.use(morgan('dev', {
  immediate: true
}));

- skip option
📌 Skip logging certain requests based on custom logic.

app.use(morgan('combined', {
  skip: (req, res) => res.statusCode < 400
}));
app.use(morgan('tiny', {
  skip: req => req.url.startsWith('/static/')
}));

-stream option
📌Instead of logging to stdout (console), you can write logs to a file or other stream.
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const logStream = fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, 'access.log'), { flags: 'a' });

app.use(morgan('combined', { stream: logStream }));
❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌

app.use(morgan('combined', {
  immediate: true,
  skip: (req, res) => req.method === 'OPTIONS',
  stream: fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, 'access.log'), { flags: 'a' })
}));
