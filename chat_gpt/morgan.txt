what is morgan?
Morgan is an HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js, most commonly used with Express.js.

📌 In Simple Terms:
Morgan logs every incoming request to your server — including the method, URL, status, response time, and more — so you can monitor traffic, debug issues, or generate access logs.

🔧 Why Use Morgan?
🐞 Debugging: Easily spot what requests are hitting your server.

📈 Monitoring: See response times, status codes, etc.

📁 Access logs: Persist logs to a file for audits or analytics.

🎨 Customizable: Use predefined formats or create your own.

🔌 Middleware: Plug-and-play with Express.


📦 Built-in Formats
Morgan provides several predefined formats to quickly log requests:

Format | Description
"combined"	    Logs everything like: IP, date, method, URL, status, referrer, user agent. Similar to Apache’s combined log format.
"common"	    A bit shorter: IP, date, method, URL, status, content length.
"dev"	        Color-coded, concise logs for development. Includes method, URL, status, response time.
"short"	        Minimal output, showing basic request data.
"tiny"	        Very minimal – method, URL, status, and response time
